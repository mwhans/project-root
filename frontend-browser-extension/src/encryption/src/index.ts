// index.ts
// Entry point for the encryption module

// Temporarily comment out real encryption exports if you don't want them used at all.
// export { encryptData, decryptData, generateKey } from './encryption';

// You could still export stubs, or comment them out entirely. Currently still exporting,
// but if the stubs are in place, they won't do real encryption.
//export { encryptData, decryptData, generateKey } from './encryption';

//export { generateKeyPair, storeKey } from './keyManagement';

// If group encryption is also not used, comment below:
// export * from './groupEncrpytion';
