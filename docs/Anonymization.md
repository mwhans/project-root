# Anonymization:
- 2 step anonymization process
  - Raw data is anonymized through tokenization and hashing as well as data aggregation and generalization. Future enhancements will include differential privacy and zero knowledge proofs.
  - When publishing to the DKG blockchain an ephemeral address system will be implemented. This will be enhanced with zkPoof capabilities as time goes on.
