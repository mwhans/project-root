# Model Training: 
- Three base open source models will be selected as starting points for further customization based on user needs

- Model data security is handled through encrypted CIDs on blockchain and IPFS storage:
  Critical model data generates CIDs that are encrypted and transmitted via anonymous routing to the blockchain, while actual model details (weights, etc.) are encrypted and stored in IPFS. Access to both blockchain CIDs and IPFS data is restricted to community members who participate in local training and storage.

- Communities can collaborate privately to develop and customize models specific to their needs through local training, encryption and data storage
