# Governance Model:

- **Decision making process**
  - **Proposal submission**
    - Shippers can propose additional knowledge assets that they would like to see added to the ecosystem as well as other enhancements.
    - Paranet operators can provide proposals for upgrades, additional knowledge assets and enhancements.
    - Node operators can also provide proposals.
    - Changes to voting policies, fee structures and other aspects of the network can be proposed also.
    - A proposal template will be developed to ensure necessary information is captured.
  - **Review period**
    - A review period will be set where members of the ecosystem can cast their vote for proposals. A forum will be provided on the governance portal to facilitate discussion and development of proposals.
  - **Voting mechanism**
    - The voting model will follow a hybrid approach where participants will have influence proportional to their token holdings and number of edge nodes operated. This will be adjustable via the governance system.
  - **Quorum and approval**
    - A minimum threshold of participation will be set to validate decisions in addition to a specific approval percentage that results in the proposal being passed.

- **Governance Roles**
  - Edge node operators, token holders and data owners will individuals and businesses in the initial rollout of the network. Both will have the option to be more involved in the network by operating full nodes. When additional internet ecosystem actors are added to the ecosystem governance will likely have to change. This will be handled by the proposal system.

- **Incentive structures**
  - Tokens distributed for submission of data to the network and active participation in proposals. The amount will be proportional to their data provided and activity in the governance community.
  - Ability to pool community resources and address pain points in data supply and demand as well as analysis in a collaborative way.
  - Additional AI/ML insights based on changes to the DKG and integration of new knowledge assets.
  - Operating a full node provides resilience to the network and operators are rewarded for maintaining the overhead.

- **Governance tools**
  - **Proposal management**
    - Web based interface with proposal template and discussion area.
    - Smart contract to manage quorum and voting as well as reward distribution.
  - **Treasury management**
    - A treasury will be created to fund enhancements to the ecosystem.
  - **Fee allocation**
    - Publishing information to the network.
    - Processes will need to be in place to ensure the cost per KB/MB is relatively stable.
    - Rewards for participation in governance.
    - Rewards for contribution of data to the network.
    - Treasury allocation to fund overall improvements to the community.
    - Paranet operators
    - Full node operators

- **Centralized World Adapter**
  - **Structure**
    - PFC template, Cayman Islands Incorporation; Magic Ramp FIAT to crypto bridge??
    - Company structured without assets, shareholders, members, trustees, or beneficiaries
    - Independent from data contributor interests
  - **Purpose**
    - Execute real-world tasks that cannot be performed by the decentralized network
    - Tasks and responsibilities determined by community governance
