# Target Audience and User Personas

## User Personas or Profiles:

Target end users for MVP are users looking to gain insights into their internet and data habits as well as the internet as a whole through developing community sourced application specific AI agents. This will be aimed at individuals and small to medium businesses who might not have advanced analytics and are looking for a way to gain knowledge about their internet habits and also build out analytics for their customer base in a way that preserves customer privacy and data autonomy. The application will be installed on device and in a browser via extensions to support collection of data. Minimal interaction is necessary to run the application as it mostly conducts its processes invisibly to the user. AI insights and governance of the network are managed in a web browser. Users have the ability to use their earned rewards to help shape the network via open governance on the Neuroweb network.

## Use Cases and Scenarios: 

Users of browser based systems will be able to add an extension to support the functionality. Desktop based solutions will use a lightweight client overlay that will mostly run in the background depending on the data integration they have. Minimal configuration will be necessary to get up and running. Information provided by the user to internet based services is captured and transformed for publishing on the DKG. The application will allow for flexibility in terms of user experience and privacy for AI. A federated learning system will be developed to train AI agents. The system can also integrate with cloud based LLM providers and be configured to use an instance of an LLM locally for querying purposes. The privacy preserving techniques of the underlying storage and Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) allow for the customers data to be properly obfuscated while still allowing the LLM to gain high level insights on aggregated data even when using cloud based LLM providers. AI insights will be aggregated in a personalized web dashboard for the customer. 

Customer data will be securely stored and recorded in the network. Contributors will have the ability to generate rewards from their contributions and theyâ€™ll also be able to query information. Over time the DKG will evolve and additional enhancements in terms of types of queries that are possible will be made and through community governance mechanisms dedicated local AI agents can be formed. A governance dashboard will also be implemented to allow for community engagement, process improvement and overall evolution of the ecosystem via participation of various actors in internet based data exchange systems.

## User flow:

- Install browser extension and desktop data management and provide their role in the internet data exchange ecosystem.

- A device linker can be provided that allows users to indicate instances of the application that are part of the same organization. 

- Users can continue their internet based data exchange activities as they normally would.

- Application initializes the overlay framework to ingest any input users provide to online services and also output received.

- Data is copied and recorded in the background as they go about their data exchange activities.

- Data is cryptographically hashed and minimal information is published to the DKG as a daily data exchange knowledge asset. Users are encouraged to provide data via crypto economic incentives.

- A web based solution for accessing all of the AI information generated from the DKG. It will allow users to use their identity credentials to see a personalized and community dashboard, create their own queries as well as change the model that they are using and purchase further advanced analytics.

- The web based solution will also include a governance area where community members can vote on proposals and collaborate with other members of the ecosystem to drive the community forward and shape the network in terms of improvements.

Note: Future enhancements will plan for the ability to ingest data from desktop software running on device locally to target high data transmission throughput and also integrate directly with operating systems.
